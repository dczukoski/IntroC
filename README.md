# VRC Intro to C++
This is example code from the Robot Revolution Introduction to C++ course.
http://robotrevolution.net

## Concepts
1. Screen display on Brain and Controller
2. Autonomous Basic Motion
3. Autonomous Motion with Ranges (Bang Bang)
4. Autonomous Motion Using Proportional Control (full PID is left for further student development)
5. Using bumpers, distance, and color sensors
6. Controller usage

The code has been written for cut/paste usage. Things that could be moved to global constants or header files are still in each function. There are extra lines of code and variables to show as much of the concept as possible.
